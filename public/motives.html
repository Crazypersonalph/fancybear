                        <p class="text">The motives of Fancy Bear are deeply connected with the motives of the Russian government.</p>
                        <p class="text">They are known to be a part of the Russian Intelligence Agency, GRU, and are known to further the strategic interests of the Russian government.</p>
                        <p class="text">Their main motives are to exfiltrate data from Western countries, which are mostly Russia's adversaries at this time, to wreak havoc in Western countries, and to destabilise the West.</p>
                        <p class="text">They have consistently attacked the US government, and associated countries and organisation for around two decades, and it is known that they are one of Russia's most experienced and technologically advanced Advanced Persistent Threats.</p>
                        <p class="text">They also work to cover up any scandals concerning the Russian Government, and work to help keep the Russian government look legitimate to the outside world.</p>

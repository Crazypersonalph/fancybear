			<ul class="hacklist">
				<li class="hacklist">German parliament - In the years of 2015 and 2018, the lower house of the German Parliament was targeted by cyberattacks. It focussed on targeting specific parties, such as Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party, and upon further investigation, was found to have been conducted by Fancy Bear, as part of the Russian Government's attempts to destabilise the West.</li>
				<li class="hacklist">Norwegian parliament - In December 2020, the Norwegian parliament was targeted by sweeping cyberattacks across its many departments. From investigations, it was found that it was Fancy Bear  was responsible for the attacks, again, to further the Russian agenda to destabilise the West, especially as Norway is a NATO member.</li>
				<li class="hacklist">TV5Monde - It is a big French broadcasting company. In April 2015, they were targeted by a massive cyberattack which destroyed the station's network systems, wiped data, and almost caused the company to collapse, due to the potential loss of commercial channel sponsors. It was initally thought to be carried out by ISIS terrorists, but was soon discovered to be the work of Russian hackers, specifically Fancy Bear. The aim was seemingly to create as much destruction as possible.</li>
				<li class="hacklist">The White House - In April 2015, the White House computer network was affected by a massive incident. A lot of unclassified, however highly important information was collected and subsequently exfiltrated, including the President's full schedule, which is extremely valuable to foreign intelligence agencies. The hack originally targetted the US Department of State, but was able to laterally move onto the White House network. After an FBI and DOJ investigation, it was found that Fancy Bear was most likely the group that had infiltrated the network.</li>
				<li class="hacklist">NATO - In recent years, especially after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, NATO has been increasingly targeted by Russian Hackers. The most recent, in 2023, was when Fancy Bear attacked a Turkish unit of NATO's Rapid Deployable Corps, which are responsible for responding to any threat that may come up without any notice. It was not clear whether NATO was directly affected, but it is most likely, and the embassies of NATO countries were also hacked in conjunction, especially those in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine.</li>
				<li class="hacklist">Democratic National Committee - In 2015 and 2016, the Democratic National Committee was hacked by Fancy Bear. It was preceding the upcoming American elections. Thousands upon thousands of emails from the committee were leaked, including confidential information about Hillary Clinton. It is thought that the hack was designed to help Donald Trump win the election, as there was proof the Republican National Committee was also hacked, but no information was leaked.</li>
				<li class="hacklist">Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe - In 2016, near the time when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, the OSCE was hacked. There was data stolen and exfiltrated, and it was aimed at slowing down a European response to the Crimean Annexation. It is commonly thought that it was Fancy Bear behind the attack, although never confirmed.</li>
				<li class="hacklist">Emmanuel Macron (President of France) - In 2017, during the French Presidential Elections, the email accounts of Emmanuel Macron were hacked. There were thousands of emails leaked, and they were original found in a Pastebin paste. Although never confirmed, it is thought that it was Fancy Bear and by extension the Russian Government who were trying to meddle with France's election.</li>
